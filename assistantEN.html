Click on the Français canadien link at the bottom of the Saba home page to access the system in French.

<div class="bubble answer inlineblock">This issue usually happens when you update your manager. When you register to a course that needs approval, the request is sent to the manager on your profile at that moment; it cannot be approved by another manager or transferred to them.</br></br>If the course is not at its registration limit, you can drop the course and re-register, which will trigger a new approval request.
